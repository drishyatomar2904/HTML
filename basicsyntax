The basic syntax of HTML includes the following elements:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies the HTML version being used (HTML5 in this case).

2. `<html>`: This element wraps all the content on the entire page.

3. `<head>`: This element contains meta-information about the document, such as its title and links to stylesheets.

4. `<title>`: This element sets the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

5. `<body>`: This element contains the content of the document, such as text, images, links, and other elements.

Here's an example of the basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic example of HTML syntax.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Example of the basic HTML syntax:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic example of HTML syntax.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type and version.
- `<html>` wraps all the content on the entire page.
- `<head>` contains meta-information about the document, including the title.
- `<title>` sets the title of the document.
- `<body>` contains the visible content of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, and other elements.
